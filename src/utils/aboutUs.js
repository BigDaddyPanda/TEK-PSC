  why_ps: `
Because we all 
have to make decisions. Whether you're a student, an engineer, a businessperson,
or the president of the Strongest Country, you face problems every day that need
solving. Maybe you're trying to save your company, keep your job, or end the 
world financial crisis. Maybe you simply need to eat better or 
find more time to spend with your family

  goal_after: `
As many people have already learned, problem solving is easy when you know how to approach
it effectively. Our aim in this bootcamp is to help our fellow friends make problem solving into a habit, 
one that empowers them to solve not only their own problems, but the challenges of 
their schools, businesses, communities -- and maybe even the world. After all, 
there must always be a solution for each problem, you just have to optimize it!
